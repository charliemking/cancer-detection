# Cancer Detection with Supervised Learning

In this project, I built classification models to predict breast cancer from tumors using the Wisconsin Diagnostic dataset. I implemented logistic regression, decision trees, and SVMs in scikit-learn and achieved 94% test accuracy. To compare model performance, I used ROC curves and confusion matrices. My main focus was interpretability and real-world relevance in healthcare applications.
