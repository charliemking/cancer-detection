# Cancer Detection with Supervised Learnong

I built classification models to predict breast cancer using the Wisconsin Diagnostic dataset. I implemented logistic regression, decision trees, and SVMs in scikit-learn and achieved 94% test accuracy. I compared model performance using ROC curves and confusion matrices, and focused on interpretability and real-world relevance in healthcare applications.
